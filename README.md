# Raspberry Pi Toolbox

Right now, this is just a disorganized collection of stuff I'll be writing down for my own personal use so I don't forget things as I get my hands on more RPis.

## Usage
1. Run `./init/create-sd-card.sh`
2. `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`
3. SSH
4. `raspi-config`
5. Ansible (TODO)
   - Change hostname
   - Change passwd
   - Create new user
